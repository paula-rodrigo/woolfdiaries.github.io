After cleaning up my data and putting it into a csv file on Excel, I used Rstudio to create a topic model for the diary entries. I was especially interested in looking at the topics over time. In the visualizations below, you will see that Woolf did not write any diary entries in 1928. I am not entirely sure why, but it may be because she was working on another book, *Orlando: A Biography*, that year. By 1929, *To the Lighthouse* had been published and Woolf may have been reflecting back on it.

I experimented with different numbers of topics, starting from 15, then 20, then 5, then 8. I found that for the size of my corpus, 8 topics was the perfect amount to see a patern in the change of topics over time.

Here we can see that she writes less about the lighthouse (shown in purple) and about Vita (shown in beige) as time goes on but more about Leonard and home life (shown in purple). This might reflect a change in Woolf and Vita's relationship after the writing and publication of *To the Lighthouse* and *Orlando*. The topics of time and books (shown in dark green) also gradually lessens over time, possibly because she would have felt less pressure to meet deadlines once her book was published. The theme of writing and loving to write (shown in black) does not see a significant change over time, which suggests to me that writing was a fundamental part of Woolf's daily life, whether or not it was because she was working on a book. It could also suggest that she was continuously writing, and enjoyed it.

![15-topics](vw-topics-year.png)
<div>Topics over time, 15 topics.</div>

![20-topics](vw-topicsovertime-20.png)
<div>Topics over time, 20 topics.</div>

![5-topics](vw-5-topics.png)
<div>Topics over time, 5 topics.</div>

I found that 15 and 20 topics were too broad and cluttered to see any meaningful patterns while 5 topics was too narrow.
