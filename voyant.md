<div>Cirrus:</div>
The cirrus shows the most frequently used words in the corpus. Here, we can see that "think" and "like" are the two most frequently used words. This suggests that Woolf used her diary as a reflective space. We can also see many words that pertain to books and writing. This suggests something of how integral writing was to Woolf's life, and perhaps for the time period, as people wrote to one another often.

<div>Terms:</div>
Here, we have a list of terms that appear in the corpus based on the frequency that the word appears. Clicking on a word shows the collocates, correlations, and phrases related to the word. Clicking on the term "think" collocates with "Leonard" and correlates with "Vita."

<div>Vita and Leonard trends:</div>
This visualization shows the trends of a term or terms. It graphs the relative frequencies of the word(s) against the corpus it appears in. Here, we can see that Leonard and Vita's names are rarely mentioned in the same corpus. We can also see that Leonard is mentioned less than Vita overall, especially during the beginning and the end of her time writing *To the Lighthouse*.

<div>"think*", "write*", "book*" links:</div>
This is a collocates graph that shows keywords and terms that occur near each other often. The links for the word "book" suggest that Woolf wanted to write something amazing. It might also suggest that the people around her wanted *To the Lighthouse* to be the best.
