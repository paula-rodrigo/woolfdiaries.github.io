# Welcome!

For this project, I downloaded the diary entries from [woolfonline.com](http://woolfonline.com/?node=content/contextual/transcriptions&project=1&parent=2&taxa=41). All 41 entries were written during the time of Virginia Woolf's writing and publishing of her novel, *To The Lighthouse*. During this process, I decided to focus on the content and the themes of her diary entries. With this in mind, I intended to do corpus linguistics to analyse her writing process. Considering her reputation today as an early feminist writer, I also wanted to do topic modelling on the corpus to see what extent those themes might be found in her personal writing. 


While this examination is in no way exhaustive, it serves as a starting point to analyse her process of writing. From what I have found so far, the corpus linguistics of Woolf's diary entries reveals how she thought of herself and her writing. The topic models created from the corpus is revealing of these things as well. Going forward, I would expand my corpus to include the essays, letters, and reviews that she wrote around the same time. Other diary or journal entries from a later time period could be used as a reference corpus to look at keywords.
