I ran my corpus through Antconc to do analyse the language used in the corpus.

Searching for common words like "I" and "my" yeilded these results:

Looking at the collocate results for the three words, it seems that Woolf tends to write about negative traits or feelings associated with herself. 

Here are the results for the collocate of "I":

Many of the words have negative connotations, like "corrupt," "disappointed," "dislike," and "uncomfortable." This might reveal something about her mental health and the pressure that she might have felt while writing.

The same pattern can be seen in the collocate results of the word "my", which colloates with words like "underworld," "temper," "destructive," and "fault":

Words like "inspection" may reveal how Woolf used her diary as a means of self-reflection and a place to document what she saw around her in her everyday life.

I also did a search of the important people in Woolf's life, particularly her husband, Leonard, and her friend and lover, Vita Sackville-West. An inital search of their names, "Leonard" and "Vita" yielded that Woolf mentioned by name Vita almost twice as much as she did with Leonard. A search for "Vita" yeilded 38 results while "Leonard" came up 18 times.

The collocate results suggest that Leonard and Woolf's relationship was one of practicality and partnership. His name seems to come up especially around money, with words like "wages," "bill," and "paid."

On the other hand, the collocate results for Vita seem to focus on the things that they would do together. There is an increase in verbs and adjectives, suggesting that Woolf was very close with Vita while she was writing *To The Lighthouse*.
